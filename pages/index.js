    <h1>The Trump Impeachment</h1>

    <p>
      WASHINGTON — The House of Representatives voted on Wednesday to transmit
      two articles of impeachment against President Trump to the Senate, sending
      the president and his party into uncharted territory in a deeply divisive
      trial fraught with history and political risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a choreographed ritual, the House formally appointed seven Democrats to
      serve as impeachment managers prosecuting the case before the
      Republican-controlled Senate. The group silently marched two charges of
      high crimes and misdemeanors, encased in slim blue folders, across the
      Capitol to set in motion the third presidential impeachment trial in
      American history.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proceedings commencing on Thursday will play out in a Capitol already
      rived by politics during a contentious election year. Among the senators
      who will be sitting in judgment of Mr. Trump will be four Democrats who
      are running for president, juggling their campaigns to defeat him with
      their duties as jurors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trial is laden with peril for Mr. Trump. He will face weeks of public
      discussion of the allegations that he solicited foreign help in the 2020
      presidential election, abusing the power of his office and obstructing a
      congressional inquiry in the process. But the president is almost certain
      to cast his likely acquittal as a complete exoneration and turn the
      considerable apparatus of his campaign to stoke public outrage. Democrats
      believe the proceeding will put pressure on Republicans — particularly
      those facing tough re-election challenges — to condemn Mr. Trump or risk
      being cast as an apologist for the president. Yet they, too, risk a
      backlash if voters sour on the impeachment effort, dismissing it as a
      political stunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We are here today to cross a very important threshold in American
      history,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said as she spoke on the House floor before
      a vote to transmit the articles. Regardless of the outcome, she added, Mr.
      Trump would be “impeached for life.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The House impeached Mr. Trump last month on charges of abuse of power and
      obstruction of Congress, formally accusing him of pressuring Ukraine to
      investigate his political opponents while withholding as leverage a nearly
      $400 million package of military assistance and a White House meeting with
      the country’s president.

      exactly a month later, was largely along party lines. Only one Democrat,
      Representative Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota, joined every Republican in
      voting “no.” The action deputized the seven impeachment managers who will
      present the House’s case. The group, mostly lawyers, included a former
      police chief and reflected the geographic and demographic diversity of the
      Democratic caucus, with three women, two African-Americans and one Latina.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hours later, after an elaborate signing ceremony, they walked two by two
      through a hushed Capitol, carrying the articles — embossed with a gold
      seal and bearing the signatures of Ms. Pelosi and the House clerk — to the
      Senate. More than two dozen Democrats, but only two Republicans — Senator
      Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Senator Kevin Cramer
      of North Dakota — sat in the chamber awaiting their arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the White House, the president denounced the effort to remove him anew
      as a “hoax” that Republicans would soon debunk — “let’s take care of it,”
      he told members of the House attending a ceremony in the East Room not
      long before the vote. Senior administration officials projected
      confidence, calling theirs an “easy case” and predicting that the Senate
      would acquit the president in two weeks without hearing from any
      witnesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the path ahead in the Senate was far from clear, as the normally staid
      chamber braced for a potentially fractious proceeding and some Republicans
      agitated for a lengthier and more thorough process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, confirmed that she and a small
      group of fellow Republicans — Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Lamar
      Alexander of Tennessee and Mitt Romney of Utah — had worked with Mr.
      McConnell to ensure there would be a vote on whether to call witnesses or
      collect new documentary evidence, once each side had presented its case
      and senators had a chance to ask questions. “It’s important that we have
      an up-or-down vote on the issue of subpoenaing witnesses and documents,”
      Ms. Collins told reporters, “and I’ve worked very hard to get that
      included, with all my colleagues that I’ve mentioned, into the governing
      resolution.” The president himself is “of two minds” on the matter, said
      Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, saying that Mr. Trump was
      vacillating between wanting a prolonged trial with a robust public defense
      of his actions and a quick dismissal.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think he feels that he’s been unjustly accused, and would like to
      present his side of it,” Mr. Paul said in an interview on Wednesday. But
      he added, “I think it’s hard to sort of turn down the idea that we could
      have a motion to end this thing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. McConnell accepted the articles late Wednesday afternoon and invited
      the managers to exhibit them at noon Thursday. The Senate will then summon
      Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who will preside over the trial, to
      administer an oath binding senators to render “impartial justice” and
      issue a summons asking the president to answer to the charges against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trial, however, will not begin in earnest until Tuesday, with debate
      on a resolution to set the rules followed by opening arguments by the
      House managers and the president’s legal team.
    </p>
    <p>
      After weeks of sharp words, Mr. McConnell sounded an unusually somber note
      on the Senate floor, in a nod to the weight of the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is a difficult time for our country, but this is precisely the kind
      of time for which the framers created the Senate,” he said. “I’m confident
      this body can rise above the short term-ism and factional fever and serve
      the long-term best interests of our nation. We can do this and we must.”
      Ms. Pelosi withheld the articles from trial for nearly a month to try to
      increase pressure on Republicans like Ms. Collins to vote for new
      evidence. Democrats argued aggressively that a trial without it is
      tantamount to an extension of Mr. Trump’s attempts to cover up his
      actions. Pressing their case, just as lawmakers were preparing to transfer
      the articles across the Capitol, the House made public another tranche of
      newly received texts, calendar entries, notes and other records
      illustrating aspects of Mr. Trump’s pressure campaign on Ukraine that
      could be used by prosecutors in the trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came from Lev Parnas, an associate of Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer
      Rudolph W. Giuliani, and appeared to detail attempts to dig up dirt in
      Ukraine on Mr. Trump’s political rivals, actions that lie at the heart of
      the House’s case. In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Parnas
      asserted that Mr. Trump had been fully aware of his efforts, though the
      two men never spoke about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Time has been our friend in all of this because it has yielded
      incriminating evidence, more truth into the public domain,” Ms. Pelosi
      told reporters.
    </p>
    <p>
      To lead the team of managers to prosecute the case, Ms. Pelosi turned to
      one of her most tested deputies, Representative Adam B. Schiff of
      California, a former federal prosecutor who oversaw the House’s Ukraine
      inquiry as the chairman of the Intelligence Committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group also includes Representatives Jerrold Nadler of New York, the
      chairman of the Judiciary Committee; Zoe Lofgren of California, a veteran
      of three presidential impeachment debates; Hakeem Jeffries of New York, a
      fast-rising Democratic leader and the party’s messaging chief; Val B.
      Demings of Florida, a former police chief; and Jason Crow of Colorado and
      Sylvia R. Garcia of Texas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several of the lawmakers have courtroom experience of some kind, a quality
      Ms. Pelosi said she had sought. Two, Mr. Crow and Ms. Garcia, are both
      first-term members, and Mr. Crow has military experience allowing him to
      speak to the national security implications of some of Mr. Trump’s
      actions. The managers met for the first time as a group on Wednesday to
      discuss strategy in the basement chambers of the Intelligence Committee,
      where the impeachment inquiry unfolded last fall.
